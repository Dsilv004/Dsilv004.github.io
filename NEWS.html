                With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down. Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of the series yet – but stand the original alongside this sequel in other ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each other. The excellent combat hasn’t gotten old, but it is largely the same fun as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others.

                Despite a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, Spider-Man 2’s combat is very familiar – it doesn’t have that new suit smell anymore, but it still feels incredibly comfy to slip back into. The rhythm of precision dodges, the new perfect parries (so you’re not only swerving and striking now), and acrobatic finishers are hugely satisfying, as is chasing high-hit combos to keep the fight as stylish as possible. The movement is smooth and the hits are crunching, like some sort of peanut butter hybrid that every one of your foes is allergic to. Power and elegance are brought together in a brick-to-the-face ballet as enemies are thrown around like dolls, juggled in the air, slammed across concrete floors, and slung into each other like body-armoured bowling pins – but, naturally, never killed. Every bone in their body may be broken and every organ punctured, but of course, they'll somehow live to commit crimes again.

                With Resident Evil 4 Remake, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and lots more launching in 2023, no one really expected a somewhat niche Dungeons and Dragons-based role-playing game to emerge as a the game's biggest hit. Looking back, however, and it's impossible not to mention Baldur's Gate 3 among the biggest news stories of the year.

                With an unprecedented number of choices and consequences that genuinely reward players' imaginations, few other games captured the attention of gamers as much in 2023. IGN deemed it a masterpiece in our 10/10 review, but it was the range of emerging wild and wacky stories that truly propelled it to smash hit status.

                From having sex with a druid disguised as a bear, stacking a dozen crates to skip to the top of a fortress, using the Dark Urge excuse to be as evil as possible, and reverse pickpocketing bosses to kill them instantly, players spent hours, days, weeks, and months exploring every inch of Baldur's Gate 3. Developer Larian Studios kept the fun going too by releasing huge updates with almost comically long patch notes, adding all sorts to the game including new endings, dialogue options, and characters.

                The Day Before — once Steam's most wishlisted game — was finally released (in Early Access) in 2023, but instead of being the incredible open world MMO survival game that was promised, it was an unmitigated disaster. Things were growing worse and worse even ahead of launch, when developer Fntastic was accused of ripping off other games like The Division, Call of Duty, The Last of Us, Cyberpunk 2077, Grand Theft Auto 5, and more, on separate occasions.

                A trademark dispute complicated things too, and seven months after it promised no more delays, Fntastic delayed The Day Before again, this time indefinitely though its PC version would arrive in Early Access just a month late. This launch did not go well, as players flagged that essentially nothing Fntastic promised was actually in the game.

                And finally, just four days after launch, when player count had dropped 90% and The Day Before entered Steam's worst ten games of all time list, Fntastic announced it was closing down and everyone who bought the game could receive a refund. In our rare 1/10 review, IGN said: "The Day Before is easily one of the worst games I’ve ever played, to the point where I’m afraid to continue running it on my PC — and if you didn’t manage to try it, you can count yourself as one of the lucky ones."

                What will likely be the biggest game of the year, the decade, and perhaps all time was announced in 2023 as Rockstar Games finally unveiled Grand Theft Auto VI. The GTA VI trailer — which reintroduces fans to Rockstar's take on Miami, Vice City — quickly broke records, dwarfing the likes of Cyberpunk 2077's reveal trailer in terms of views. Lasting 90 seconds, it featured a ton of intricate details (here are 99 things IGN spotted) and plenty of references to wild and wacky real life events too.

                While the game was revealed alongside the 2025 release date for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, PC players were left frustrated, though not necessarily surprised, that their platform was left off the list.

                They weren't the ones a little peeved though, as several developers from Rockstar itself took to social media to express their frustration at the trailer leaking early. In fact, the entire industry shared their disappointment that the exciting moment was dampened. Several streamers were also hit with content strikes and takedowns in the wake of the leak.

                Versus Evil, the indie publisher perhaps best known for games like Stoic's The Banner Saga trilogy and Obsidian Entertainment's Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, is shutting down, with former employees saying parent company tinyBuild has laid off the entire team.

                "Today is a sad day. After 10 wonderful years, Versus Evil is shutting its doors," Versus Evil's official X/Twitter account shared. "We've loved bringing you the best indie games we could find and sharing so many happy memories with you all, our amazing community! From the bottom of our hearts, THANK YOU for everything! "

                Versus Evil shared the news after a number of former employees posted on social media about being laid off.

                "Entire 13 person company, Versus Evil, laid off today December 22 at the start our Christmas break," Versus Evil director of product strategy Francis Fincke wrote in a LinkedIn post on Friday.

                "Welp. That was a fun 10 year ride," wrote head of production Lance James on X/Twitter. "The entire Versus Evil team has just been laid off."

                James added that it "wasn't a Versus Evil decision or choice," with community manager Chris Trippi also writing on X/Twitter that it was a tinyBuild call.

                "Unfortunately our parent company has made the decision to lay off the entire team here at Versus Evil," Trippi wrote.

                Arguably the biggest free-to-play game available right now, Fortnite has grown from an ambitious multiplayer shooter to a cultural behemoth. The game’s objective is simple: defeat 99 other players in a free-for-all battle and be the last one standing. You drop into a massive world and must quickly track down some equipment, finding guns, building structures and eliminating other players as you go. Meanwhile, the boundaries of the map will begin to constrict, funnelling you into a central arena where you’ll fight to be crowned the winner.

                On paper, Fortnite’s a fairly standard battle royale shooter, but over the years its reach has stretched far outside of the genre. Whether it’s new game modes, crossover cameos, in-game concerts, movie screenings or an ever-expanding story with interactive events, Fortnite is now a multi-media sensation. All of Fortnite’s multiplayer modes are free-to-play, with microtransactions limited to cosmetics and a seasonal battle pass.

                Blending the colourful mascot platformer and the battle royale genre, Mediatonic’s Fall Guys first launched in 2020. It has since gone free-to-play, opening its doors to new players wanting to experience its unique brand of multiplayer platformer mayhem. You can enjoy all of Fall Guys’ multiplayer modes for free, with paid content limited to an in-game cosmetic store and a premium seasonal battle pass with unique unlocks.

                For those new to Fall Guys, the game sees 100 players step into the shoes of clumsy bean-shaped competitors as they battle against each other in a high-stakes game show spread across a series of increasingly difficult rounds. Think of it as Human: Fall Flat meets Takeshi’s Castle. The last player standing is the winner, taking home valuable points they can exchange for new costumes, emotes, and more. Fall Guys has grown exponentially in the years since its debut, with the game moving through multiple seasons and adding a variety of new stages.

                A chaotic mix of arcade racing and soccer, Rocket League has been a fixture of the free-to-play scene since it shifted to the model back in 2020. Pitting up to 8 players against each other as they attempt to launch a giant soccer ball into their opponent’s goal using small race cars, Rocket League is simple to pick up but tricky to master. Players will have to work efficiently as a team to defend against their opposition and score stylish goals.

                With a huge community, Rocket League is arguably one of the most popular multiplayer titles in the gaming space right now. It’s also updated frequently, with developer Psyonix adding new seasons, events, game modes and cosmetics regularly. All of Rocket League’s multiplayer modes are free, with players able to purchase cosmetic items from an in-game store.

                Fallout London, the 'DLC-sized mod' for Fallout 4 from Team FOLON, has received a new deep-dive trailer and release date of April 23, 2024 - a bit less than two weeks after the premiere of Prime Video's Fallout show.
                Fallout London was delayed back in June from the third quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter to get out of the way of Starfield. However, it appears the team needs a bit more time to get this mod just right. To help with the wait, it shared a 13-minute overview of Fallout London that breaks down exactly why the world should be excited for it.
                Team FOLON shared the news on X/Twitter, saying, "despite being content-complete as planned, upon careful considerations, we've recognised that our testing process may not be as robust as we desire."
                "To be candid, the main factor influencing this decision lies in the composition of our scripting team," Team FOLON continued. "A significant portion of our team members come from a region affected by conflict, which has understandably impacted their focus on the mod. As such, it caused us to fall behind schedule. Only through a clever reorganisation and reskilling of team members have we manged to catch up, but it has come at the cost of testing.

                From developer and publisher Vertigo Games, Arizona Sunshine 2 is a VR zombie survival first-person shooter that puts you back in the shoes (and head) of the dark-humoured and sarcastic survivor introduced in the 2016 original game. Continuing to survive alone in the heat of the Arizona desert, the unnamed hero witnesses a helicopter crash. Desperate for human contact he strikes out to find the landing site only to discover a different sort of companion… Whether you’re an old hand at blasting brains, or you’re taking on the zombie hordes for the first time, here’s what you need to know about Arizona Sunshine 2.

                The Story at the End of the World
                Experience this new frontier in blood-pumping, zombie-blasting action alongside a gripping narrative that tells the story of one man’s survival. After a heavy night of drinking his troubles away, the protagonist wakes up to find the undead (which he refers to collectively as ‘Fred’) are still shuffling about, and he is still very much alone. When he locates the crash site of a downed helicopter, hoping to find survivors, he’s surprised to find the only one left alive is a waggy-tailed, fetch-loving dog. Together, the hero and his four-legged friend, Buddy, set out to find the elusive Patient Zero, in the hope of prompting a military rescue. With a campaign twice as long as the first game, you’ll experience the twists, turns, highs and lows of this sun-drenched zombie survival story, alongside the main character’s darkly comic quips and sarcastic comments, brought to life by returning voice actor Sky Soliel.
